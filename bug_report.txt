* Sorting function: [one of sort1.c0, sort2.c0, or sort3.c0]

* Defect Observed:

  - Contents of favorites.txt:

  - Expected output:

  - Actual (incorrect) output:

* Hypothesis about what is going wrong:

* Experiments that can confirm or reject the hypothesis (note, this might
  include adding print statements to the code, making changes to the code, and
  running with different variations of the input file):

* Upon experimenting, the hypothesis should be confirmed or rejected.

  - If rejected, then develop a new hypothesis:

  - If needed: new experiment:

Now, make the necessary changes to fix the program (note: these changes should
be committed as a single commit).

* Commit the (short) SHA of the fix(es) (This should be a 7-digit string):

* Challenge (BONUS): what algorithm do you think is being implemented in this program?
